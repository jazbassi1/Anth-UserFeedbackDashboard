# UserFeedbackDashboard

This project displays the top 5 prioritized user feedback items based on criteria such as urgency and impact. It demonstrates how to collect, catalog, process, and present user feedback.

## How It Works

- **Data:** Feedback is stored in `data/feedback.json`.
- **Processing:** JavaScript in `src/dashboard.js` fetches the feedback data, calculates a score for each item, sorts them, and displays the top 5.
- **UI:** The dashboard is a simple HTML table styled with `src/style.css`.

## How to Run

1. Open `src/index.html` in a web browser.
2. The dashboard will load the feedback data and display the top 5 items.
